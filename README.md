Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The game follows standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules, where a player wins if they manage to place three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. If the grid is full and no player wins, the game results in a draw.

Features:
âœ… Two-Player Mode â€“ Players take turns marking their symbol on the board.
âœ… Winning Detection â€“ The game checks for winning conditions and announces the winner.
âœ… Draw Condition â€“ If the grid is full and no one wins, it displays a draw message.
âœ… Simple UI & Interactive Design â€“ Clean and responsive interface with smooth gameplay.
âœ… Restart Option â€“ Players can restart the game anytime.

This project is a great example of interactive web development using JavaScript for logic handling and CSS for styling. ðŸŽ®âœ¨
